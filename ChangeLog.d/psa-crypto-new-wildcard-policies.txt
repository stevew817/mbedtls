Features
   * Added PSA_ALG_AEAD_WITH_AT_LEAST_THIS_LENGTH_TAG and
     PSA_ALG_AT_LEAST_THIS_LENGTH_MAC as wildcard algorithms in PSA Crypto.
     These algorithm values describe that a key is allowed to be used with any
     algorithm that matches the specified base algorithm (e.g PSA_ALG_CCM for
     AEAD or PSA_ALG_CMAC for MAC) and has a tag/MAC length which is at least
     as long as the one encoded in the AT_LEAST_THIS_LENGTH_MAC/TAG wildcard
     algorithm.
