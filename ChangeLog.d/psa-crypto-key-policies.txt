Features
   * Added PSA_ALG_AEAD_WITH_MINIMUM_LENGTH_TAG and
     PSA_ALG_MAC_WITH_MINIMUM_LENGTH_TAG as usage algorithms for declaring key
     usage in PSA Crypto. These algorithm values describe that a key is allowed
     to be used with any algorithm that matches the specified base algorithm
     (e.g PSA_ALG_CCM for AEAD or PSA_ALG_CMAC for MAC) and has a tag length
     which is at least as long as the one encoded in the MINIMUM_TAG_LENGTH
     usage algorithm.
